<p>To understand Digital Archaeology, it is important to consider what it is as a discipline. The typical view of Digital Archaeology is that it began as a component of traditional archaeological practices. In a blog post, for instance, Ashley Richter describes Digital Archaeology as "the study of the archaeological past using technology." This is a common definition in public, as well as academic, circles. In an article by Jeremy Huggett, for instance, makes a similar claim as Richter that Digital Archaeology is an extension of traditional archaeology. From this position, Huggett notes how the digital or technical components often serve a supplementary role in archaeology. The article continues to note how approaches can be taken in Digital Archaeology, including challenges and collaboration, to "[generate] major change, [expand] boundaries, [intensify] research activities, and [mobilize] resources." Thus, while Digital Archaeology is considered as originating as an extension of traditional archaeology, there is some reason to believe it has the potential to become much more.</p>
      
      <p>So how can it become more? The technology, method and theory, and ethics sections above attempt to address this questions. The current state of these components of Digital Archaeology may appear to still be just a dimension of traditional archaeology, but perhaps with changes in upcoming years the discipline will be altered significantly. Overall, it is pretty simple to say that Digital Archaeology is merely an extension of traditional archaeological practices, but can it continue to be viewed like this? And if it can, should it?</p>
