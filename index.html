<p>To understand Digital Archaeology, it is important to consider what it is as a discipline. The typical view of Digital Archaeology is that it began as a component of traditional archaeological practices. In a blog post, Ashley Richter describes Digital Archaeology as "the study of the archaeological past using technology."<sup>1</sup> This is a common definition in public, as well as academic, circles. Likewise, Jeremy Huggett makes a similar claim that Digital Archaeology is an extension of traditional archaeology. Huggett notes, for instance, how the digital or technical components often serve a supplementary role in archaeology. The article continues to note, however, that approaches including challenges and collaboration can "[generate] major change, [expand] boundaries, [intensify] research activities, and [mobilize] resources."<sup>2</sup> As a result, Huggett demonstrates how Digital Archaeology, while arguably originating as an extension of traditional archaeology, has the potential to become much more than a tool of traditional archaeology.</p>

      <p>So how can it become more? The technology, method and theory, and ethics sections attempt to address this question. These are certainly concerns of traditional archaeology, but Digital Archaeology inevitably adds new dimensions due to its digitized and technical nature. Thus, while it is simple to say that Digital Archaeology is merely an extension of traditional archaeological practices, can it continue to be viewed like this? And if it can, should it? This question forms the central concern for the following sections of this project.</p>
